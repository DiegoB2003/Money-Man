## How To Use
Upon logging in or making a new account, this app displays a user's expenses graphically through an interactive pie chart on the home page. To begin tracking expenses, you must:
- Add spending categories by clicking "Edit Categories" on the home page or "Add Categories" in the 3-bar drawer menu.
- Make spending entries by clicking "Add Spending" on the home page.
- View your spending activity in a list format by clicking "Closer Look" on the home page.
- View your Money Man notifications by clicking "Notifications" in the 3-bar drawer menu. You will receive notifications when you reach or surpass a budget limit for a category.
- Click on a notification to review your spending activity.
